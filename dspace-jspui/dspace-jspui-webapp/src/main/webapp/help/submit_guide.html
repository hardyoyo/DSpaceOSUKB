<h2>The Inessential Guide to Submitting Items into the Knowledge Bank</h2>

<p> The Knowledge Bank is a service of the OSU Libraries and the Office of the
CIO, built using a software platform jointly developed by Hewlett-Packard Company
and MIT. The OSU Libraries uses the Knowledge Bank as a long-term storage system
for digital documents; it captures, preserves, and provides access to the research
output of OSU researchers, centers, and labs. </p>

<p>
This document gives a brief overview of how the Knowledge Bank works. It
is oriented to help anyone get started submitting to the Knowledge Bank
quickly.  Because the Knowledge Bank is not your run-of-the-mill content
management system, we hope you'll review the concepts presented
here, and that doing so will help you prepare and submit your
files more smoothly.
</p>

<p>
On to the overview!  First, two meta-points:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
This is a very simplified overview of the Knowledge Bank; there is
much more extensive documentation available within the Knowledge Bank itself
and elsewhere, some of which is referenced in this document.  If
you don't see what you need to know, don't hesitate to <a
href="mailto:libkbhelp@lists.acs.ohio-state.edu">contact us</a>.
</li>

<li>
This guide is geared toward those who intend to submit a
small number (one, or a handful, but not thousands!) of files
for storage in the Knowledge Bank.  This would apply to you if you want to
store an article, or some images, or code, or if you're in a
position where you might be regularly asked to submit an article
or working paper on behalf of others, but not necessarily many
at once.  We've developed a web interface for uploading content
which we think you'll find straightforward for occasional or
regular uploads, but we have other tools for loading a large
bulk of content at once.  If you have a large collection of
digital materials you'd like to load into the Knowledge Bank, please contact
us directly and we can discuss what the best approach for you
might be.
</li>

</ol>


<h3>What you need to know about submitting to the Knowledge Bank</h3>

<h4>The Submission Process</h4>

<p> You will need to be logged in to the Knowledge Bank before you can submit.
Most collections will also require specific authorization for you before you can
submit to it. Contact the organizers of the collection to which you wish to submit
if you are unsure whether you have permission. </p>

<p>
After starting a submission, you will be led through a
seven-step process:  these include some basic questions about
your materials first, then several screens where you can
describe your materials (see <a href="#metadata">metadata</a>
below), then file uploads, a verification screen (where you can
even compare file checksums if you wish), and a license granting
screen.  Each of these steps has more detailed documentation
available as links on each screen.
</p>

<p> After you finish, the folks administering the collection to which you are
submitting may review, edit, or approve your submission according to the collection's
policies. In other words, your materials might not go directly into the archive.
Check with the organizers of your collection for their policy if you want to know
how it will work. </p>


<h4>On the Organization of the Knowledge Bank</h4>

<p> The Knowledge Bank content is organized into communities, with logical groups
of materials organized into collections within individual communities. The atomic
unit of content in the Knowledge Bank is an "item", a.k.a. one "thing", whether
that's a single file article, or a single dataset made of several files, or several
file format versions of the same image. Take a look at the <a
href="/dspace/community-list">communities overview</a>, and <a
href="/dspace/browse?type=title">browse some Knowledge Bank items</a> to get a feel for how
it works. If you have questions about whether your materials should be one or
several items, or even a collection, <a href="mailto:libkbhelp@lists.acs.ohio-state.edu">get in touch with us</a>
and we'll be happy to consult with you. </p>


<a name="metadata">
<h4>On Metadata in the Knowledge Bank</h4>

<p>
We librarians are big on metadata.  Hopefully after thinking
about it a bit you will be too.  In collections as big as
libraries, of which the Knowledge Bank is just a part, being able to find a
single item or a set of relevant items for a given user in some
context of information need is very dependent on the quality and
consistency of descriptive information available for querying.
Some description can be done mechanically: file sizes,
checksums, and full-text indexing, for instance, are critical
elements, so we've built those in.  But we also need a higher
order of human-made description, to determine things like
titles, authors, unique identifiers, and abstracts.  If the Knowledge Bank
handled just one genre of content (say, just articles), we could
standardize formats and templates to make this easier.  The Knowledge Bank
handles many genres, and many formats, however, so we need your
help in providing this description.
</p>

<p>
The Knowledge Bank uses a qualified version</a> of <a
href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> as a descriptive
lingua franca across all content.  Some communities or
collections may also have tailored metadata available (such as
MARC records for book collections, or FGDC records for
geographic datasets). But even where that's available for some
items, we crosswalk more detailed metadata records into our
Dublin Core vocabulary to ensure a common layer of descriptive
specificity for browsing and searching across everything.  The
"describe" pages in the submission interface map the values you
enter to our vocabulary:  what you enter will be what others use
to find your content in the future.  So please take a moment to
read the explanations of each field, check the help screens,
and read our vocabulary documentation if
you're interested.  And don't hesitate to <a
href="mailto:libkbhelp@lists.acs.ohio-state.edu">contact us</a> with questions,  comments, or
concerns!
</p>



<a name="formats">
<h4>On File Formats</h4>

<p>
Over time, items stored in the Knowledge Bank will be preserved
using a combination of time-honored techniques for data
management and best practices for digital preservation.  As for
specific file formats, however, obsolescence and proprietary
formats make it impossible to guarantee the exact same level of
preservation support services for every file.
</p>

<p>
We have written a format support policy that we believe balances
the needs of most researchers with the long-term reality and costs
of supporting changing technologies over time.  Put simply, our
policy for file formats is:
</p>

<ul>
<li>everything put into the Knowledge Bank will be retrievable</li>
<li>we will recognize as many files' formats as possible</li>
<li>we will support as many known file formats as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
Complete documentation of this policy, including
a list of currently known and supported formats, is available in
<a href="/dspace/help/formats.html">the Knowledge Bank Supported Formats</a>.  That document
explains exactly what we mean by "support", and explains what to do
if you have files with formats that aren't already listed.
</p>


<a name="access">
<h4>Access control</h4>

<p>
The Knowledge Bank implements access controls so items requiring usage
restrictions will be properly limited.  Some collections are
limited to OSU network access only, for instance; other
materials might be made freely available to anyone in the
world.  Please ask your collection's administrators what the
collection's default access policies are.  If you have an item
that requires a different level of control than the default,
please let the administrators know, and we can work together to
set your items up properly.
</p>

<p>
If you are at all unsure about whether you have permission
to submit a particular item to the Knowledge Bank, don't do it!  Get in touch
with us and we'll help figure it out what will be best.
</p>



<a name="help">
<h4>Where to Go for Help</h4>

<p> The fastest ways to contact the Knowledge Bank support staff is to call the
  Libraries at 292-6151 and ask for Knowledge Bank support, or via our help list,
  libkbhelp@lists.acs.ohio-state.edu. You can quickly send email to our help list
  from anywhere in the Knowledge Bank; just click "feedback" at the bottom of
  any page. Be sure to give us a valid email address so we can respond.</p>

<h4>Where to Go for More Information</h4>

<p>
We intend to publish a broad range of Knowledge Bank documentation within
our own Knowledge Bank community; look there for more details about:
